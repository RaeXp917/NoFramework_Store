## Description

This is a simple full-stack e-shop web application developed as a student project. It allows users to browse and search for products, view them in a paginated list, sort them by price or name, and add items to a shopping cart. Orders can be placed without a login system to keep things simple and focused on functionality.

The project includes an admin panel for basic product management (add, edit, delete), viewing customer orders, and analyzing purchase trends with a chart showing the most purchased products.

This e-shop was built from scratch without using any frameworks, showcasing a solid understanding of full-stack development and database integration.

**Note**: If you want to access the admin panel, there is a text file inside the `student-supplies-store` folder that contains the admin password. I added a login and password for the admin panel for demonstration purposes, and you can find the details in that text file.
