# Student Supplies Store (Pen & Panic)

A simple full-stack e-shop web application developed as a student project. It allows users to browse and search for products, view them in a paginated list, sort them by price or name, and add items to a shopping cart. Orders can be placed without a login system to keep things simple and focused on functionality.

**Languages**: The app includes support for two languages â€“ Greek and English.

The project includes an admin panel for basic product management (add, edit, delete), viewing customer orders, and analyzing purchase trends with a chart showing the most purchased products.

This e-shop was built from scratch without using any frameworks, showcasing a solid understanding of full-stack development and database integration using PHP, MariaDB, and Docker.

## Getting Started (Docker Setup)

*   [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running.
*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed (for cloning the repository).

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RaeXp917/eshop-project.git
    ```
    *(Assuming this is your correct repository URL)*

2.  **Navigate to Project Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd eshop-project
    ```
    *(Or `cd student-supplies-store` if the repo root doesn't match the folder name)*

3.  **Ensure `database.sql` is Present:**
    Verify that the `database.sql` file exists in the project root directory. This file contains the necessary database schema and initial data.

4.  **Build and Start the Docker Containers:**
    Run the following command in the project directory:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```
    *   This command builds the PHP/Apache image based on the `Dockerfile` and starts the web server and database containers defined in `docker-compose.yml`.
    *   The first time you run this, Docker will download the necessary base images (PHP and MariaDB), which might take a few minutes.
    *   The `-d` flag runs the containers in the background.

### Accessing the Application

*   Once the containers are running (the `docker-compose up` command finishes), open your web browser and navigate to:
    `http://localhost:8080`
*   You should see the homepage of the e-shop!

### Accessing the Admin Panel

*   The admin panel requires a password for access.
*   You can find the admin password inside the `admin_pass.txt` file located in the project's root directory.

### Stopping the Application

To stop the running Docker containers, navigate back to the project directory in your terminal and run:

```bash
docker-compose down
